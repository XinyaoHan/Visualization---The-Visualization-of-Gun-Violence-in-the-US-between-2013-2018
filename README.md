# Visualization---The-Visualization-of-Gun-Violence-in-the-US-between-2013-2018

This is a project conducted by Yajie Xiao & Xinyao Han for NYU course CSCI-SHU 235.     
This visualization system demonstrates major gun violence cases across the U.S with a geographical map and cross-filter bar charts. The geographical map visualizes geographical features of gun violence cases, proposes detailed case information with a hoover information box, and redirects users to crime report webpage with on-click action.
